Explanation of Concepts:
1. Functions with Parameters and Return Values:

    greet(name, age) is a simple function that takes two parameters: name and age. It returns a formatted string using the provided arguments.
    A function can have any number of parameters and can return a value using the return keyword.

2. Default Arguments:

    greet_with_default(name, age=25) has a default argument for age. If the caller doesn't provide a value for age, it defaults to 25.
    Default arguments provide flexibility by allowing functions to be called with fewer arguments.

3. Variable-Length Arguments (*args):

    sum_numbers(*args) accepts a variable number of arguments (packed into a tuple) using the *args syntax. Inside the function, we sum the values using sum(args).
    This allows the function to accept any number of positional arguments.

4. Variable-Length Keyword Arguments (**kwargs):

    describe_person(name, **kwargs) accepts variable-length keyword arguments (packed into a dictionary) using the **kwargs syntax.
    This allows the function to handle a flexible number of named arguments. We iterate over kwargs to print each key-value pair.

5. Lambda Functions:

    multiply = lambda x, y: x * y defines a lambda function. Lambda functions are simple, anonymous functions that can be used in a more compact form.
    In this case, the function takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their product.

6. Nested Functions:

    In the outer_function(x) example, we define a nested function inner_function(y) inside the outer function.
    Nested functions can access variables from the enclosing function (this is known as lexical scoping).

7. Higher-Order Functions:

    apply_function(func, value) is an example of a higher-order function. It takes another function (func) as an argument and applies it to the value.
    This is common in functional programming and allows functions to be passed around as arguments.

8. Decorators:

    The decorator(func) is a decorator function that modifies the behavior of the function it decorates. In this case, it adds print statements before and after the execution of the function.
    The @decorator syntax is used to apply the decorator to the multiply_numbers(a, b) function.

9. Recursion:

    The factorial(n) function is an example of recursion, where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
    This function calculates the factorial of a number by calling itself with a decremented value of n until it reaches the base case (n == 0).

Key Concepts Covered:

    Function parameters: Passing values into functions to make them more dynamic.
    Return values: Sending values back from functions to be used elsewhere.
    Default arguments: Providing default values for function parameters.
    Variable-length arguments: Accepting an arbitrary number of arguments with *args and **kwargs.
    Lambda functions: Creating anonymous functions for concise operations.
    Nested functions: Functions defined inside other functions.
    Higher-order functions: Functions that take other functions as parameters or return functions.
    Decorators: Functions that modify or extend the behavior of other functions.
    Recursion: Functions that call themselves to solve problems in smaller subproblems.

This example should give you a solid understanding of how to define and use functions in Python, as well as some advanced function concepts!
